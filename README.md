# Welcome

Welcome to my first To Do List App!

# About

This is a To Do List web app written in Javascript using node, express, and react. The frontend and backend API are deployed and hosted using Firebase. Authentication is handled through Firebase and the app is connected to a Firestore database. Ant Design was used for styling and additional components.

You can access your To Do app from anywhere that has internet access, so feel free to use it on desktop, tablet, phone, etc.


# How To

The app was purposely made to be fairly simple to use. 

In order to use the app, first log in or sign up with username/password or Google login. Both are as secure and your password will be encrypted and never revealed. 

After logging in, you will then see the main To Do List page. In order to list a new to do list item, type the item in the input field and then either hit enter or hit 'Add'. Your list will appear below.

To edit your list, click the checkmark icon to cross-through an item and to delete an item, click the trash can icon. 

Feel free to log out when finished, but don't feel like you have to.

Remember, you can access your to do list from anywhere that you can access the internet.

Enjoy.
